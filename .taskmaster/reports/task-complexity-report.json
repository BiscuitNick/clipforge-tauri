			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up recording infrastructure and permissions",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create recording.rs module structure, 2) Implement macOS permission handling (screen, camera, mic), 3) Set up cross-platform permission abstraction, 4) Create recording state management system, 5) Define recording configuration data structures, 6) Implement cleanup and error recovery mechanisms",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to platform-specific permission APIs, state management requirements, and need for robust error handling across multiple recording types. Requires deep Tauri integration and careful architectural design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement screen and window enumeration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement macOS screen/window enumeration using Core Graphics, 2) Create data structures for source metadata, 3) Generate window/screen thumbnails, 4) Handle multi-monitor configurations, 5) Implement frontend serialization and IPC commands",
			"reasoning": "Requires platform-specific APIs for screen capture enumeration, thumbnail generation, and handling various edge cases like multiple monitors and different window types. Complex due to native API integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement core screen recording functionality",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement AVFoundation screen capture for macOS, 2) Configure H.264/AAC encoding pipeline, 3) Add system audio capture integration, 4) Implement recording controls (start/stop/pause), 5) Add real-time duration and file size tracking, 6) Handle recording to temporary then final locations, 7) Implement recording cancellation and cleanup",
			"reasoning": "Most complex task - requires deep platform API integration, video/audio encoding configuration, real-time monitoring, and careful resource management. AVFoundation complexity and cross-platform considerations make this very challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create screen recording UI components",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create recording button and integrate into MediaLibraryPanel, 2) Build screen selection modal with thumbnail grid, 3) Implement recording status indicator with timer, 4) Add audio controls and error display components",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity - existing React patterns and UI components can be leveraged. Main challenges are state management integration and real-time timer updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement webcam recording system",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement camera enumeration backend command, 2) Set up MediaRecorder API with getUserMedia, 3) Create blob-to-file Tauri command for MP4 saving, 4) Build camera selection UI and live preview, 5) Implement recording controls with audio toggle",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity using web APIs but requires careful blob handling, Tauri file operations, and coordination between frontend MediaRecorder and backend file saving."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add audio capture and monitoring features",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create audio device enumeration backend, 2) Implement Web Audio API analyzer for VU meter, 3) Build audio level indicator UI component, 4) Add mute/unmute controls with visual feedback, 5) Integrate audio with screen and webcam recording",
			"reasoning": "Requires Web Audio API expertise for real-time analysis, backend audio enumeration, and integration with multiple recording modes. Moderate complexity with some technical challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Picture-in-Picture recording system",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement simultaneous screen+webcam capture backend, 2) Create PiP configuration data model, 3) Build PiP position/size selector UI, 4) Implement live preview with overlay, 5) Handle separate file recording with sync metadata, 6) Store configuration for export compositing",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to simultaneous recording coordination, UI preview requirements, and metadata management for later compositing. Requires careful synchronization handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate recordings with media library",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Hook recording completion to auto-import system, 2) Integrate with existing thumbnail generation, 3) Update MediaLibraryPanel to show new recordings, 4) Extract and display file metadata",
			"reasoning": "Lower complexity as it leverages existing systems. Main work is integration points and ensuring smooth data flow from recording to library display."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PiP export compositing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Extend export system for PiP detection, 2) Calculate FFmpeg overlay filter parameters, 3) Implement video compositing pipeline, 4) Handle audio track selection, 5) Add composite progress tracking",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring FFmpeg filter expertise and integration with existing export system. Mathematical calculations for overlay positioning add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add comprehensive error handling and edge cases",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement permission error handling with user guidance, 2) Handle device unavailability gracefully, 3) Add disk space monitoring and errors, 4) Implement long recording memory management, 5) Create comprehensive cleanup for all failure scenarios",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity spread across many edge cases. Requires thorough testing and consideration of various failure modes but builds on existing infrastructure."
