# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Video Preview Player
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a video preview player to display and play selected clips from the timeline.
# Details:
Create a `PreviewPlayer` React component using the HTML5 `<video>` element as recommended for MVP. Use Tauriâ€™s `convertFileSrc()` to generate a playable URL from the file path. Implement play/pause controls and ensure video maintains aspect ratio with synchronized audio. Load the clip into preview on timeline click. Sync playhead position with video `currentTime` for accurate playback feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Select a clip on timeline and confirm it loads in preview. Test play/pause functionality and verify audio sync with video. Check aspect ratio preservation (no stretching). Ensure playback achieves minimum 30fps for 1080p content using browser performance tools.
