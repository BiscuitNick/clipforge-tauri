The compressRGBtoJPEG function (ScreenCaptureKit.swift:406-463) creates a CGImage from RGB pixel data using CGDataProvider and then utilizes CGImageDestination with kCGImageDestinationLossyCompressionQuality property for JPEG compression. Quality configuration is handled through the jpegQuality property (0.3-0.8 range) set via configureJPEGQuality method (lines 120-126). The compression is integrated into the frame processing pipeline in handleVideoFrame (lines 571-593), occurring after RGB conversion and before frame queue insertion. Compression ratio logging shows typical 5-10x reduction in data size. This Swift-native approach eliminates the need for Rust-side image processing, reduces FFI overhead, and leverages hardware-accelerated CoreGraphics operations for better real-time performance.
