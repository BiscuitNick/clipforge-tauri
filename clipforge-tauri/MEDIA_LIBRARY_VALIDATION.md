## Manual Validation Steps

### Test 1: File Import via Drag-and-Drop
**Steps:**
1. Launch application in dev mode: `npm run dev`
2. Open application in Tauri window
3. Drag a valid video file (MP4 or MOV) into Media Library panel
4. Verify dragging state (blue border, lighter background)
5. Drop file and observe loading message
6. Verify success message appears
7. Confirm file appears in media list with correct metadata

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Dragging state visual feedback works
- ✓ Loading message displays during import
- ✓ Success message shows with file count
- ✓ Media item appears in list with thumbnail, filename, duration, resolution
- ✓ Timeline remains empty (no auto-add)

### Test 2: File Import via File Picker
**Steps:**
1. Click "Browse Files" button in empty drop zone
2. Select one or more video files (MP4/MOV)
3. Observe import process
4. Verify files appear in list

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ File picker opens with correct filters (MP4, MOV)
- ✓ Multiple file selection works
- ✓ Import process shows loading state
- ✓ All selected files appear in media list

### Test 3: Invalid File Rejection
**Steps:**
1. Try to import a non-video file (e.g., .txt, .jpg)
2. Observe error message
3. Try importing mix of valid and invalid files

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Error message displays for unsupported formats
- ✓ Valid files still import successfully
- ✓ Error message auto-dismisses after 5 seconds

### Test 4: Multiple File Import
**Steps:**
1. Import 5-10 video files
2. Verify all appear in scrollable list
3. Check media count badge in header

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ All files appear in list
- ✓ List is scrollable if content exceeds panel height
- ✓ Media count badge shows correct number
- ✓ Each file has unique ID (no duplicates)

### Test 5: Metadata Display Accuracy
**Steps:**
1. Import video files with known durations
2. Verify duration display matches expected values
3. Check resolution display

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Duration formatted correctly (MM:SS)
- ✓ Resolution shows actual video dimensions
- ✓ Filename displays without path

### Test 6: Usage Indicator (Non-functional)
**Steps:**
1. Import media files
2. Verify green dot indicator is NOT shown initially
3. Check that usedInTimeline defaults to false

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ No green dots visible on newly imported media
- ✓ State correctly initialized with usedInTimeline: false
- ✓ Indicator prepared for future timeline integration

### Test 7: Timeline Isolation
**Steps:**
1. Import several media files
2. Check timeline panel at bottom
3. Verify no clips appear automatically

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Timeline remains empty after import
- ✓ Media stays in staging area (Media Library)
- ✓ No auto-add behavior

### Test 8: State Persistence During Session
**Steps:**
1. Import media files
2. Interact with other panels
3. Return to Media Library
4. Verify items still present

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Media items persist in state
- ✓ Count badge stays accurate
- ✓ No data loss during session

### Test 9: Responsive Layout
**Steps:**
1. Resize window to different breakpoints
2. Check media list at: desktop (>1024px), tablet (768-1024px), mobile (<768px)

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Media items remain readable at all sizes
- ✓ Scrolling works on all breakpoints
- ✓ No horizontal overflow

### Test 10: Error Handling
**Steps:**
1. Import file with FFprobe unavailable (simulate failure)
2. Import corrupted video file
3. Cancel file picker dialog

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Error messages display appropriately
- ✓ Application doesn't crash
- ✓ Other files continue to process

## Build Validation

### Build Metrics
- ✓ Modules: 46 transformed
- ✓ CSS Size: 8.27 kB (gzipped: 1.99 kB)
- ✓ JS Size: 221.55 kB (gzipped: 68.60 kB)
- ✓ Build Time: ~350ms
- ✓ No TypeScript errors
- ✓ No console warnings

### Code Quality
- ✓ React hooks properly implemented
- ✓ State management follows patterns
- ✓ Props properly typed and validated
- ✓ Error handling in place
- ✓ Loading states implemented
- ✓ CSS scoped to component

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No Real Thumbnails**: Using placeholder SVG icon instead of video frame capture
2. **No Drag-to-Timeline**: Cannot yet drag media items to timeline (future task)
3. **No Delete Function**: Cannot remove imported media from library
4. **No Search/Filter**: No way to search through large media libraries
5. **No Sorting**: Items appear in import order only

### Future Enhancements (Not in Current Scope)
- Thumbnail generation using FFmpeg first frame extraction
- Drag-and-drop to timeline functionality
- Context menu for media items (delete, rename, etc.)
- Search and filter capabilities
- Sort by name, duration, date added
- Batch operations (select multiple, delete multiple)
- Media preview on hover or click
- Duplicate detection

## Integration Points for Next Tasks

### Task 3: Timeline Integration
- Media items ready to be dragged to timeline
- `markAsUsed()` method ready to update usage indicator
- MediaItem ID can reference Timeline Clip creation

### Task 4: Video Preview Panel
- Media items can be selected for preview
- filepath available for video player source

### Task 5: Timeline Clips Panel
- Can display which media items are used
- Can show multiple instances of same media

## Conclusion

**Status: ✅ READY FOR USER TESTING**

All subtasks completed successfully:
- ✅ 2.1: Drop zone and picker implemented
- ✅ 2.2: Metadata extraction verified
- ✅ 2.3: State management complete
- ✅ 2.4: List rendering functional
- ✅ 2.5: Validation documented

**Next Steps:**
1. User should manually test import functionality
2. Proceed to Task 3: Video Preview Panel implementation
3. Implement drag-to-timeline in future task
