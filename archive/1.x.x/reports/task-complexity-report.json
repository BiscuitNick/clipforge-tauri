		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Application Layout and State Management",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks covering layout scaffolding, state management interface definition, and responsive layout verification.",
			"reasoning": "Mostly structural work setting up layout skeleton and defining TypeScript interfaces; moderate effort with limited logic but needs responsive CSS and state-store wiring."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Media Library Panel with Staging Area",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for file ingestion UI, metadata extraction pipeline, state updates, media list rendering, and validation/testing steps.",
			"reasoning": "Requires drag/drop integration, media metadata extraction, asynchronous processing, and state synchronization along with UI rendering, making it a multi-faceted implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Video Preview Panel with Paused-on-Load Behavior",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for player UI construction, state-driven media loading, playback control logic, and loop/paused-on-load behaviors.",
			"reasoning": "Custom video controls tied to application state with precise playback rules introduce moderate complexity, especially ensuring correct paused-on-load and looping behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Timeline UI Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for layout structure, time ruler rendering, playhead interactions, and synchronized scrolling implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Static UI but requires synchronized ruler/track scrolling and playhead positioning logic; moderate front-end complexity without data mutations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Request clarification for the missing title, description, and requirements before creating subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Task lacks specifications; only effort is gathering or defining requirements before any implementation planning can proceed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Drag-to-Timeline with Independent Clip Instances",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks covering drag source setup, drop handling on timeline, clip instantiation logic, state updates, and visual feedback/testing.",
			"reasoning": "Integrates drag-and-drop library with stateful clip creation, unique ID management, and positional calculations, requiring careful coordination between UI and data layers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Absolute Positioning, Gap Handling, and Collision Detection",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for position calculation, collision validation logic, UI feedback for invalid drops, state updates, gap rendering, and regression tests.",
			"reasoning": "Complex timeline logic enforcing spatial constraints and visual feedback; collision detection and gap rendering significantly increase implementation and testing difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Timeline Playback with Gap Handling",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Plan subtasks for playhead timing loop, clip lookup and frame mapping, gap black-screen handling, preview integration, controls synchronization, and playback tests.",
			"reasoning": "Requires real-time playback loop coordinating multiple clips, handling gaps, and syncing with preview component, demanding meticulous state management and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Timeline Clips Panel",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for state subscription/sorting, list and expansion UI, editable fields with validation, and synchronization testing with the timeline.",
			"reasoning": "Involves dynamic list rendering with sorting, expandable editing controls, and bidirectional state updates affecting the main timeline; moderate data/UI complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Clip Manipulation: Trimming and Copy/Paste",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for trim handle UI, in/out point adjustment logic, clipboard state slice, paste placement, and interaction testing.",
			"reasoning": "Combines intricate UI interactions with precise state mutations and clipboard mechanics, increasing complexity and test coverage requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Keyboard Shortcuts",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for global listener management, shortcut-to-action mapping, focus and accessibility considerations, and integration tests for key sequences.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple shortcuts mapping to timeline actions require centralized handling and conflict management, but leverage existing features; moderate implementation effort."
